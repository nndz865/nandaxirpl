## Architecture Components

### 1. Client
The client is divided into two main parts: Electron and Web.

#### 1.1 Electron
- **Main Process**: The entry point of the Electron application, responsible for initializing the app and creating the main window.
- **Renderer Process**: This part handles the user interface using React. It includes components for displaying financial charts and other UI elements.

#### 1.2 Web
The web client serves as an alternative interface for users who prefer a browser-based experience. It shares many components with the Electron client.

### 2. Server
